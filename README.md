### 👋  Hi there!

- 👩‍💻 I'm currently working with React (TypeScript or Javascript), with NextJS, sometimes with React Native and Ionic.
- 🧐 I'm interested in IOT: I've recently written feedback about [beacons experience](https://medium.com/xebia-france/iot-molkky-beacons-ble-node-104217633109) and have created an [app](https://www.heart-rate-tracker.app/) to use Bluetooth Web API.
- ✍️ I try to write articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@proustibat).
- 🐦 I [tweet](https://twitter.com/proustibat) about tech but also about other stuff I found interesting and that you may not find interesting
- 🗣 I work on my skills as a [speaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKxxyyLnkeY) at conferences.
- 🇫🇷 I've been living in [Paris](https://goo.gl/maps/quHaGj15ju2nEHma9), France for many years.
